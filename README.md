# This repo is a collection of scripts that I have written in Python in order to make working with the command line easier

Most of these scripts are meant to be used in a Linux environment, and have been created in order for me to gain more experience with Python scripting as I pursue SRE-type roles.

If you would like to use these scripts, most of the modules will have instructions on how to use the script in your own setting. If you see anything here that you'd like to inquire more about, please feel free to reach out to me at my [email](lindseyhemenez@gmail.com) or on [Twitter](twitter.com/itslindseydrew). Happy scripting!
